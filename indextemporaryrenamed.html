        <h2 class="blog-post-title">When I started to change my life...</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="https://www.thehealthy.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-stories/">Original source</a></p>

        <p> had never really tried to lose weight as I honestly had no idea how. I was always bigger but felt I was just meant to be bigger. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>With each kid, I seemed to gain more weight and got more uncomfortable with how I looked. In 2012, I decided to lose weight. I was turning 30 years old: I wanted to start the decade off right. My oldest was three years old. She was starting to take notice of the foods I was eating.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I wouldn’t allow her to drink Pepsi or eat a bunch of chips <strong>but she saw me doing these things</strong> she started to ask me for soda.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My aha moment: I realized I wouldn’t be a good example if I was eating or drinking the same junk I told her she couldn’t have. I wanted my kids to grow up with a healthy diet. I didn’t want them to ever struggle with their weight or a food addiction. I set my mind to lose the weight, and I found a calorie-counting app called MyFitnessPal. I wasn’t interested in fad diets or eliminating foods because that didn’t seem sustainable. But counting calories sounded like a viable option. I wound up losing 120 pounds in two years. I also learned that if you have a bad day, don’t let it turn into a bad week—just start again. Be patient. <em>As long as you’re persistent it will happen.</em> I had to change my mindset. </p>
        <h2>Seek accountability</h2>
        <p>I’ve always had problems with my weight. My family never did any type of physical activity, and we were always eating junk food. I never learned how to eat the right way.</p>
        <h3>Set an example for your kids</h3>
        <p>You can do a lot to help your child reach and maintain a healthy weight. ... In the short run, for example, he or she may have breathing problems or joint pain, ... Don't put your child on a weight-loss diet unless your child's doctor tells you to.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Encourage open dialogue.</h3>
        <p>Go ahead and talk with your children about weight and encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings about body image whenever they arise. When children discuss feelings about weight with you, be sure to listen and acknowledge that the feelings are real.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't make negative comments.</li>
          <li>Take action, every move is magic.</li>
          <li>Avoid the blame game.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What to Do if Your Child Says, "I'm So Fat."</h3>
        <p>Learn where the thoughts about feeling fat came from.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Did a friend or classmate tease your child about weight?</li>
          <li>Did another relative mention the size of your child's belly or thighs? </li>
          <li>Is your child feeling embarrassed from having snug-fitting clothes? </li>
          <li>Was there something on television or online about overweight kids?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After a hurricane comes a rainbow.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">The 8 Best Exercises for Weight Loss</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">February 25, 2021 by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-exercise-for-weight-loss">Original source</a></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Walking</li>

          <li>Cycling</li>

        <p>It’s estimated that half of all American adults attempt to lose weight every year.

          Aside from dieting, exercising is one of the most common strategies employed by those trying to shed extra pounds. It burns calories, and this plays a key role in weight loss.
          
          In addition to helping you lose weight, exercise has been linked to many other benefits, including improved mood, stronger bones, and a reduced risk of many chronic diseases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db313.htm">Attempts to Lose Weight Among Adults in the United States, 2013–2016</a>. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Think  <strong>fat Loss, Not Weight Loss</strong> but people should really aim for fat loss</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One study in 345 adults with excess weight or obesity found that fiber intake was the most significant dietary factor in promoting weight loss, regardless of calorie intake or the macronutrient composition of their diet.</p>
        <p>Exercise can help you achieve this by burning off some extra calories.

          However, some people claim that exercise isn’t effective for weight loss on its own.
          
          This may be because exercise increases hunger in some people, making them eat more calories than they burned during the workout.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Foods to avoid</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">March 27, 2021 by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/f-factor-diet-review-does-it-work-for-weight-loss#foods-to-avoid">Original source</a></p>

        <p>Highly processed foods and low quality carbs should be minimized for the best weight loss results. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refined grains: white bread, pasta, crackers, white rice, biscuits, tortillas</li>
          <li>Processed foods: candy, potato chips, fast foods, french fries, baked goods</li>
          <li>Refined oils: canola oil, soybean oil, corn oil, hydrogenated fats</li>
          <li>Sugar-sweetened beverages: soda, fruit juice, sweet tea, sports drinks, energy drinks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that even though these foods don’t offer much in the way of nutrition or health benefits — and can even contribute to a higher risk of certain chronic diseases <em>diet allows you to enjoy them on occasion </em> if you want to.</p>
